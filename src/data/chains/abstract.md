Abstract is a Layer 2 blockchain designed specifically for consumer crypto applications. Built as an Ethereum L2, it focuses on enabling developers to create trading platforms, games, AI tools, and social networks without traditional infrastructure limitations.

The platform emphasizes accessibility and performance for consumer-facing applications, providing a foundation for building applications that can scale to mainstream adoption. Abstract is positioned as "the builder's platform for consumer crypto," targeting developers who want to build the next generation of decentralized consumer applications.

While technical specifications like block size and launch date are still emerging as the network develops, Abstract has secured backing from notable investors including EVG and Fenbushi Capital, signaling strong industry support for their consumer-focused approach to blockchain infrastructure.
