Ethereum is the original smart contract blockchain, launched in 2015. It enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) using the Solidity and Vyper programming languages. Ethereum is secured by proof-of-stake consensus and is the home of the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. The protocol is governed by open community discussion and formal improvement proposals (EIPs).
