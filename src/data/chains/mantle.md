An Ethereum Layer 2 built with Optimistic Rollup architecture, integrating modular data availability (EigenDA) and transitioning toward ZK finality via OP Succinct.

- **Security & Data Availability**  
  - Runs as an optimistic rollup with fraud proofs; proof window still ~7 days.  
  - Posts calldata to Ethereum and now uses EigenDA for off-chain data availability with slashed validator nodes.  
  - Plans to enable zk-proof finality (~1 hour) via SP1 (ZKVM) integration.  

- **Infra & Execution**  
  - Modular architecture separates execution, data availability, and settlement layers.  
  - Sequencer is centralized, but roadmap includes gradual decentralization.  

- **Performance**  
  - High throughput (~2M txs per quarter reported).  
  - Low gas fees under normal L1 conditions; DA costs can rise with Ethereum congestion.  
  - Fast block inclusion; zk-based finality (when live) will reduce settlement delay drastically.  

- **Use Cases**  
  - Suitable for DeFi protocols and financial apps that need deep liquidity, fast confirmation, and modular infra without leaving the Ethereum trust boundary.  

- **Trade-offs**  
  - Still depends on centralized sequencer and token-governed upgrade path.  
  - DA decentralization (EigenDA) improves censorship resistance but introduces new validator assumptions.  
  - zk finality not yet live â€” current withdrawals require fraud proof challenge period.  
  - Not ideal for real-time apps or builders requiring full trust minimization today.
