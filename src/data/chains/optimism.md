Optimism is a fast, low-cost Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, utilizing optimistic rollups to increase throughput and reduce fees. It is fully EVM-equivalent, allowing developers to deploy existing Ethereum contracts and use familiar tools. Optimism is governed by the Optimism Collective and its community.
