Polygon zkEVM is a zero-knowledge rollup that combines the security of Ethereum with the scalability and low costs of Layer 2s, while maintaining full EVM equivalence. Unlike Polygon PoS, zkEVM is a true Layer 2 that inherits Ethereum's security through cryptographic proofs rather than relying on its own validator set.

The key innovation is its use of zero-knowledge proofs to validate state transitions: every transaction batch is accompanied by a cryptographic proof that can be quickly verified on Ethereum, ensuring that all state changes are correct without needing to re-execute transactions. This provides the same security guarantees as Ethereum itself, but with much higher throughput and lower costs.

For developers, Polygon zkEVM offers a seamless experienceâ€”existing Ethereum tools, contracts, and wallets work out of the box without modification. The network uses the same opcodes and produces the same bytecode as Ethereum, making it truly EVM-equivalent rather than just EVM-compatible. This means you can deploy your existing Solidity contracts without any changes and they'll behave exactly as they would on Ethereum mainnet.

The trade-off is slightly higher costs compared to Polygon PoS (though still much lower than Ethereum), as generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs requires computational resources. However, for applications that need strong security guarantees and trust-minimized bridging to Ethereum, zkEVM provides an excellent solution.
