Create a new chain $ARGUMENTS in the data/chains.json file in the same format as other chains

IMPORTANT — before adding check @src/data/chains/ethereum.md and @src/data/chains/ethereum.ts and use as a reference
IMPORTANT - rpcs.json file is huge, do not try to read it, just grep by $ARGUMENTS chain name
Take chain id rpcs, testnet, faucest and testnet rpcs from @rpcs.json file
Make sure you're writing description in the same style as other chains, no marketing bullshit, only key details important for builders

Fetch chain's website for brand colors and logo
If you are missing some data just leave it empty and IMPORTANT — tell after finishing task what was missed so user could add it manually.
Do not hallucinate any data, if you are not sure about something, just leave it empty.
