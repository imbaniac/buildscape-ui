Sony's entertainment-focused L2 with IP protection that blocked meme coins on launch day, sparking community backlash.

**Key Difference:** Built-in IP protection system that restricts contracts suspected of infringement â€” blocked Sony-themed meme coins (Aibo, Toro) and froze funds, prioritizing corporate IP over permissionless deployment.

**Best for:** Entertainment companies needing IP protection, Sony ecosystem partners, regulated applications requiring compliance controls.

**Technical:** OP Stack optimistic rollup with IP protection layer, RPC-level contract restrictions, curated application ecosystem.

- **Use Cases**
  - **Entertainment IP**: Sony Music/Pictures NFTs, anime titles like Solo Leveling
  - **Event management**: On-chain ticketing, fan engagement platforms
  - **Curated ecosystem**: Soneium Spark selected 32 apps from 1,700+ applicants
  - **Corporate Web3**: Applications requiring IP compliance and content controls

- **Security & Data Availability**
  - Optimistic rollup on OP Stack with standard 7-day withdrawal period.
  - Centralized sequencer operated by Sony Block Solutions Labs.
  - Fraud proofs limited to authorized actors, not permissionless.

- **Infra & Execution**
  - EVM-equivalent with OP Stack and Superchain compatibility.
  - IP protection system flags suspected infringing contracts.
  - Restrictions apply at RPC level; direct L1 submission possible with delays.

- **Performance**
  - Processes ~8 operations per second on average.
  - Low fees (typically <$0.001 per transaction).
  - Batch intervals: ~9 minutes for transactions, ~2 hours for state updates.

- **Trade-offs**
  - Blocked popular meme coins on launch, freezing ~$100k in user funds.
  - Contract restrictions prevent permissionless deployment.
  - RPC-level controls make flagged contracts invisible on explorers.
  - 12-hour delay required to bypass restrictions via L1.
  - Philosophy conflicts with crypto's permissionless ethos.
