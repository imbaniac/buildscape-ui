BitDAO's L2 with a massive treasury backing its ecosystem. Still an optimistic rollup but testing ZK upgrade for 1-hour withdrawals.
The key difference: $3.9B treasury (from BitDAO merger) funding ecosystem growth, plus first L2 using EigenDA for cheaper data storage and SP1 zkVM on testnet.

**Best for:** Projects wanting treasury-backed grants/incentives, DeFi needing deep liquidity pools, apps betting on the ZK transition.

**Technical:** Optimistic rollup transitioning to ZK validity rollup via OP Succinct/SP1, EigenDA for data availability, MNT token.

- **Security & Data Availability**  
  - Still optimistic rollup with 7-day withdrawal period on mainnet.  
  - First L2 using EigenDA for data availability (80% cheaper than posting to Ethereum).  
  - ZK upgrade with SP1 in testnet, mainnet timeline unclear.

- **Infra & Execution**  
  - Modular architecture: separate execution, DA, and settlement layers.  
  - Centralized sequencer (decentralization "on roadmap").  
  - MNT as native token, plus mETH/cmETH liquid staking derivatives.

- **Performance**  
  - Sub-cent transaction fees with EigenDA.  
  - Standard optimistic rollup throughput currently.  
  - After ZK upgrade: 1-hour finality vs 7 days.

- **Use Cases**  
  - **Treasury-backed DeFi**: $200M EcoFund investing in projects
  - **Liquid staking**: mETH ($335M+ staked), integrated yield products
  - **Stablecoin integrations**: Ethena USDe, Agora AUSD, Ondo USDy
  - **Bitcoin bridge**: fBTC for wrapped Bitcoin liquidity

- **Trade-offs**  
  - Centralized sequencer with vague decentralization timeline.  
  - ZK upgrade not live yet â€” still 7-day withdrawals.  
  - Success depends on treasury management and DAO governance.  
  - EigenDA adds external dependency and validator assumptions.
