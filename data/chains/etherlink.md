The only EVM rollup on Tezos, using XTZ for gas. Cheap and fast but isolated from mainstream EVM liquidity.

**Key Difference:** Built directly into Tezos protocol ("enshrined") rather than external, with fraud proofs settled by Tezos validators instead of Ethereum.

**Best for:** Projects already in Tezos ecosystem wanting EVM compatibility, apps needing sub-cent transaction costs.

**Technical:** Smart Rollup on Tezos with fraud proofs, XTZ as native token, sub-second confirmations with 16-second finality.

- **Use Cases**
  - **DeFi**: IguanaDEX (concentrated liquidity DEX), SuperLend (lending), Curve deployment
  - **Gaming**: BattleRise, Bit Hotel, UPvsDOWN, Degeneratives
  - **Incentives**: Apple Farm program boosted TVL from low millions to peak near $50M
  - **Bridges**: LayerZero and Stargate for cross-chain connectivity

- **Security & Data Availability**
  - Settles on Tezos L1 using fraud proofs and commitment publishing.
  - Finality in 2 Tezos blocks (16 seconds after Quebec upgrade).
  - Permissionless: anyone can run a node and challenge invalid state.

- **Infra & Execution**
  - Built with Tezos Smart Rollup framework, enshrined in protocol.
  - Standard EVM with some RPC differences due to Tezos backend.
  - Uses XTZ for gas instead of ETH.

- **Performance**
  - Sub-second soft confirmations.
  - Very low fees (sub-cent transactions).
  - Calypso upgrade improved contract processing speed significantly.

- **Trade-offs**
  - Isolated from Ethereum L2 ecosystem â€” bridges required for ETH assets.
  - Limited tooling support compared to Ethereum-based L2s.
  - Smaller ecosystem despite incentive programs.
  - WebSocket support limited, requiring polling for subscriptions.
