The L2 that pays you yield just for holding ETH and stablecoins â€” no staking needed, your balance just grows. The key difference: Your bridge deposits get invested in DeFi protocols behind the scenes, but this means extra risk beyond typical L2s, and the chain saw massive user decline after airdrop incentives ended.

**Best for:** Users wanting automatic yield on idle funds, yield-focused DeFi experiments, risk-tolerant builders.

**Technical:** Modified OP Stack that auto-stakes bridge funds and implements rebasing token balances.

- **Security & Data Availability**
  - Optimistic rollup but fraud proofs aren't live yet
  - Fully centralized sequencer control
  - Contracts upgradeable instantly via multisig
  - Your funds are actively at risk in external DeFi protocols

- **Infra & Execution**
  - OP Stack heavily modified for native yield
  - Bridge ETH goes into liquid staking tokens
  - Stablecoins deployed to T-Bill protocols
  - Balances automatically rebase (increase) in your wallet

- **Performance**
  - Can handle high TPS but actual usage is low
  - 2-second block times
  - Had massive TVL at launch, lost most after airdrop
  - Currently minimal organic activity

- **Use Cases**
  - **Passive yield**: Your ETH/USDB earn ~4-5% doing nothing
  - **Yield-first apps**: Build assuming users already earn baseline yield
  - **High-risk DeFi**: Leverage the native yield for experiments
  - **Fantasy.top**: One of the few apps with real users

- **Trade-offs**
  - Your bridge funds are in DeFi protocols (can be hacked or lose value)
  - No fraud proofs means trusting sequencer completely
  - Can be upgraded instantly (rug risk)
  - Lost significant adoption after incentives dried up
